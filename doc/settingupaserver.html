  <h2>Setting up a Server</h2>
  <p>Requirements:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>A web host (apache, lynx, whatever)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Performance off of the default server (http://cupm.net/public/bacongamejam-01/server.php) is very slow because it is from a BlueHost server. To increase performance, run it localhost on your machine. I've noticed the best performance happens when it is run over a network.</p>
  <p>Provided is steps to installing a Flight 2942 server.</p>
  <ol>
  <h2><li>Upload server files.</h2>
    <p>Copy <code>server.php</code> and <code>server-config.php</code> to a public directory. In this case, we will use <code>/var/www/</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <h2><li>Create a MySQL database and user.</h2>
    <p>In this case, the database name will be <code>bacongamejam-01</code></p>
    <p><i>Note: Since this software was made so quickly, I highly suggest you make a new user for this software, as I have not done any injection testing or protection.</i></p>
  </li>
  <h2><li>Import the database structure.</h2>
    <p>Import or recreate the structure as defined by <code>structure.sql</code></p>
  </li>
  <h2><li>Configure the server.</h2>
  <p>Configure <code>server-config.php</code> to properly connect the MySQL database.</p>
  <p><i>Note: An easy way to check that the server is working is to visit the page via a browser, and see if the page returns "{}". If so, your server is properly set up. If not, an error message will show up.</i></p>
  </li>
  <h2><li>Configure the client to connect to the server.</h2>
  <p>Currently, the game client reads from the <code>server.lua</code> file and uses that as the server. The cupm server connection (located in <code>server-cupm.lua</code>) looks like this:<p>
<pre>
  server.name = "cupm.net (Seppi)"
  server.url = "http://cupm.net/public/bacongamejam-01/server.php"
</pre>
  <p>An example of connecting to the localhost (located in <code>server-localhost.lua</code>would be like this:</p>
<pre>
  server.name = "localhost"
  server.url = "http://localhost/bacongamejam-01/server.php"
</pre>
  To set up <code>server.lua</code> for your server, you will need to name the server (<code>server.name</code>) and give it your url (<code>server.url</code>). The best way is to find your outbound IP address, and use that. e.g. :
<pre>
  server.name = "Foo's Internal Server"
  server.url = "http://192.168.1.2/bacongamejam-01/server.php"
</pre>
  <div class="ubuntu">To find your ip address, open up a terminal and type <code>ifconfig</code>.</div>
  <div class="windows">To find your ip address, open up a terminal and type <code>ipconfig</code>.</div>
  <h2><li>Play Flight 2942</h2>
  And that's all folks! Have fun. Just connect, and go.
