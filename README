A spin off of the NES 1942, but with spaceships. Also, it runs off a php server, and can support as many players as your server can.

  Upload the server.php, server-config.php to the server.
  Make a new MySQL database, and insert the structure.sql to it.

  Some have noticed that there are server lags. Try unzipping thee folder, otherwise your OS is probably blocking the http request.
